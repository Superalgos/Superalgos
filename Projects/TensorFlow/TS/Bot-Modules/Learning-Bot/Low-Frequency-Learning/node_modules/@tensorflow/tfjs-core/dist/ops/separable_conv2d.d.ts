/**
 * 2-D convolution with separable filters.
 *
 * Performs a depthwise convolution that acts separately on channels followed
 * by a pointwise convolution that mixes channels. Note that this is
 * separability between dimensions [1, 2] and 3, not spatial separability
 * between dimensions 1 and 2.
 *
 * See
 * [https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/separable_conv2d](
 *     https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/separable_conv2d)
 * for more details.
 *
 * @param x The input tensor, of rank 4 or rank 3, of shape
 *     `[batch, height, width, inChannels]`. If rank 3, batch of 1 is
 * assumed.
 * @param depthwiseFilter The depthwise filter tensor, rank 4, of shape
 *     `[filterHeight, filterWidth, inChannels, channelMultiplier]`. This is
 *     the filter used in the first step.
 * @param pointwiseFilter The pointwise filter tensor, rank 4, of shape
 *     `[1, 1, inChannels * channelMultiplier, outChannels]`. This is
 *     the filter used in the second step.
 * @param strides The strides of the convolution: `[strideHeight,
 * strideWidth]`. If strides is a single number, then `strideHeight ==
 * strideWidth`.
 * @param pad The type of padding algorithm.
 *   - `same` and stride 1: output will be of same size as input,
 *       regardless of filter size.
 *   - `valid`: output will be smaller than input if filter is larger
 *       than 1x1.
 *   - For more info, see this guide:
 *     [https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/nn#Convolution](
 *          https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/nn#Convolution)
 * @param dilations The dilation rates: `[dilationHeight, dilationWidth]`
 *     in which we sample input values across the height and width dimensions
 *     in atrous convolution. Defaults to `[1, 1]`. If `rate` is a single
 *     number, then `dilationHeight == dilationWidth`. If it is greater than
 *     1, then all values of `strides` must be 1.
 * @param dataFormat: An optional string from: "NHWC", "NCHW". Defaults to
 *     "NHWC". Specify the data format of the input and output data. With the
 *     default format "NHWC", the data is stored in the order of: [batch,
 *     height, width, channels]. Only "NHWC" is currently supported.
