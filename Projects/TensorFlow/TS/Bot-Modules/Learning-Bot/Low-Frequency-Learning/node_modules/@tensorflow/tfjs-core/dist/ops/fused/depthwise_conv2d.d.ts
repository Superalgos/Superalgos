/**
 * Computes depthwise 2D convolution, optionally fused with adding a
 * bias and applying an activation.
 *
 * Given a 4D `input` array and a `filter` array of shape
 * `[filterHeight, filterWidth, inChannels, channelMultiplier]` containing
 * `inChannels` convolutional filters of depth 1, this op applies a
 * different filter to each input channel (expanding from 1 channel to
 * `channelMultiplier` channels for each), then concatenates the results
 * together. The output has `inChannels * channelMultiplier` channels.
 *
 * See
 * [https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/depthwise_conv2d](
 *     https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/depthwise_conv2d)
 * for more details.
 *
 * @param obj An object with the following properties:
 * @param x The input tensor, of rank 4 or rank 3, of shape
 *     `[batch, height, width, inChannels]`. If rank 3, batch of 1 is
 * assumed.
 * @param filter The filter tensor, rank 4, of shape
 *     `[filterHeight, filterWidth, inChannels, channelMultiplier]`.
 * @param strides The strides of the convolution: `[strideHeight,
 * strideWidth]`. If strides is a single number, then `strideHeight ==
 * strideWidth`.
 * @param pad The type of padding algorithm.
 *   - `same` and stride 1: output will be of same size as input,
 *       regardless of filter size.
 *   - `valid`: output will be smaller than input if filter is larger
 *       than 1x1.
 *   - For more info, see this guide:
 *     [https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/nn#Convolution](
 *          https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/nn#Convolution)
 * @param dilations The dilation rates: `[dilationHeight, dilationWidth]`
 *     in which we sample input values across the height and width dimensions
 *     in atrous convolution. Defaults to `[1, 1]`. If `rate` is a single
 *     number, then `dilationHeight == dilationWidth`. If it is greater than
 *     1, then all values of `strides` must be 1.
 * @param dataFormat: An optional string from: "NHWC", "NCHW". Defaults to
 *     "NHWC". Specify the data format of the input and output data. With the
 *     default format "NHWC", the data is stored in the order of: [batch,
 *     height, width, channels]. Only "NHWC" is currently supported.
 * @param dimRoundingMode A string from: 'ceil', 'round', 'floor'. If none is
 *     provided, it will default to truncate.
 * @param bias Tensor to be added to the result.
 * @param activation Name of activation kernel (defaults to `linear`).
 * @param preluActivationWeights Tensor of prelu weights to be applied as part
 *     of a `prelu` activation, typically the same shape as `x`.
 * @param leakyreluAlpha Optional. Alpha to be applied as part of a `leakyrelu`
 *     activation.
