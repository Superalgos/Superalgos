/**
 * Computes the norm of scalar, vectors, and matrices.
 * This function can compute several different vector norms (the 1-norm, the
 * Euclidean or 2-norm, the inf-norm, and in general the p-norm for p > 0)
 * and matrix norms (Frobenius, 1-norm, and inf-norm).
 *
 * ```js
 * const x = tf.tensor1d([1, 2, 3, 4]);
 *
 * x.norm().print();  // or tf.norm(x)
 * ```
 *
 * @param x The input array.
 * @param ord Optional. Order of the norm. Supported norm types are
 * following:
 *
 *  | ord        | norm for matrices         | norm for vectors
 *  |------------|---------------------------|---------------------
 *  |'euclidean' |Frobenius norm             |2-norm
 *  |'fro'       |Frobenius norm	           |
 *  |Infinity    |max(sum(abs(x), axis=1))   |max(abs(x))
 *  |-Infinity   |min(sum(abs(x), axis=1))   |min(abs(x))
 *  |1           |max(sum(abs(x), axis=0))   |sum(abs(x))
 *  |2           |                           |sum(abs(x)^2)^1/2*
 *
 * @param axis Optional. If axis is null (the default), the input is
 * considered a vector and a single vector norm is computed over the entire
 * set of values in the Tensor, i.e. norm(x, ord) is equivalent
 * to norm(x.reshape([-1]), ord). If axis is a integer, the input
 * is considered a batch of vectors, and axis determines the axis in x
 * over which to compute vector norms. If axis is a 2-tuple of integer it is
 * considered a batch of matrices and axis determines the axes in NDArray
 * over which to compute a matrix norm.
 * @param keepDims Optional. If true, the norm have the same dimensionality
 * as the input.
