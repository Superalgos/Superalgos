/**
 * Computes the maximum of elements across dimensions of a `tf.Tensor`.
 *
 * Reduces the input along the dimensions given in `axes`. Unless `keepDims`
 * is true, the rank of the `tf.Tensor` is reduced by 1 for each entry in
 * `axes`. If `keepDims` is true, the reduced dimensions are retained with
 * length 1. If `axes` has no entries, all dimensions are reduced, and an
 * `tf.Tensor` with a single element is returned.
 *
 * ```js
 * const x = tf.tensor1d([1, 2, 3]);
 *
 * x.max().print();  // or tf.max(x)

 *
 * ```js
 * const x = tf.tensor2d([1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 2]);
 *
 * const axis = 1;
 * x.max(axis).print();  // or tf.max(x, axis)
 * ```
 *
 * @param x The input tensor.
 * @param axis The dimension(s) to reduce. By default it reduces
 *     all dimensions.
 * @param keepDims If true, retains reduced dimensions with size 1.
