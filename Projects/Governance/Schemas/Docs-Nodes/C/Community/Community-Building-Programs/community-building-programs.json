Then, Bob brings his friend Charly to Superalgos. Charly sets up his profile and declares Bob as his referrer. So now Bob gets 10% of the Referral Power that Charly drives to his User Referrer node. Can you see what happens with Alice's Incoming Referral Power? That's it! She gets 10% of Bob's power, which includes 10% of Charly's power!",
