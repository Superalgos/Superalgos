/**
 * Computes the mean of elements across dimensions of a `tf.Tensor`.
 *
 * Reduces `x` along the dimensions given in `axis`. Unless `keepDims` is
 * true, the rank of the `tf.Tensor` is reduced by 1 for each entry in `axis`.
 * If `keepDims` is true, the reduced dimensions are retained with length 1.
 * If `axis` has no entries, all dimensions are reduced, and a `tf.Tensor` with
 * a single element is returned.
 *
 * ```js
 * const x = tf.tensor1d([1, 2, 3]);
 *
 * x.mean().print();  // or tf.mean(a)
 * ```
 *
 * ```js
 * const x = tf.tensor2d([1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 2]);
 *
 * const axis = 1;
 * x.mean(axis).print();  // or tf.mean(x, axis)
 * ```
 *
 * @param x The input tensor.
 * @param axis The dimension(s) to reduce. By default it reduces
 *     all dimensions.
 * @param keepDims If true, retains reduced dimensions with size 1.
