 * Computes the confusion matrix from true labels and predicted labels.

 * ```js
 * const labels = tf.tensor1d([0, 1, 2, 1, 0], 'int32');
 * const predictions = tf.tensor1d([0, 2, 2, 1, 0], 'int32');

 *
 * @param labels The target labels, assumed to be 0-based integers
 *   for the classes. The shape is `[numExamples]`, where
 *   `numExamples` is the number of examples included.
 * @param predictions The predicted classes, assumed to be
 *   0-based integers for the classes. Must have the same shape as `labels`.
 * @param numClasses Number of all classes, as an integer.
 *   Its value must be larger than the largest element in `labels` and
 *   `predictions`.
 * @returns The confusion matrix as a int32-type 2D tensor. The value at
 *   row `r` and column `c` is the number of times examples of actual class
 *   `r` were predicted as class `c`.
