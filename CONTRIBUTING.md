# Contributing

We are thrilled you are interested in contributing to this project. Your help may be essential to the project's success and we want you in! 

Superalgos is a collective project, currently at a very early stage. We not only welcome contributions but may even choose to incentivize relevant contributions via the project's native crypto token, to be deployed in the near future.

Please read the [Join the Dev Team]( https://superalgos.org/developers-join-dev-team.shtml) page in our website to learn more about how you may become a relevant member of the Superalgos Project and even make a living of contributing code.

Contributions are deemed _voluntary work_, irrespective of the incentives that may be in place, and are subject to the conditions described in the software [LICENSE](LICENSE).

## Getting Started

First step is to fork this repository and start using the app. The repository includes all source code which constitutes your development environment. The app runs uncompilled on the actual code.

* The priority at this moment is the stabilization of existing functionality. Your first contribution will be using, learning, and testing the app, and reporting any bugs you may find.

* You may debug and remove bugs yourself, and submit pull requests.

* Another top priority is building a robust base of indicators and technical studies. This is done from the UI, using the functionality managed by data mines.

As you engage with other developers and the Core Team, we will get to know you and develop a relationship, so that you may later participate in core development tasks.

Please join the [Superalgos Develop](https://t.me/superalgosdevelop) Telegram group, let us know about your progress and ask any questions you may have. Feel free to let us know about yourself and your personal interests.
