elephant: "This is a sample definition."

baseball: "Baseball is considered America's pasttime sport, though that may be more of a historical term than a current one. There's a lot more excitement about football than baseball. A baseball game is somewhat of a snooze to watch, for the most part."

basketball: "Basketball is a sport involving two teams of five players each competing to put a ball through a small circular rim 10 feet above the ground. Basketball requires players to be in top physical condition, since they spend most of the game running back and forth along a 94-foot-long floor."

football: "No doubt the most fun sport to watch, football also manages to accrue the most injuries with the players. From concussions to blown knees, football players have short sport lives."

soccer: "If there's one sport that dominates the world landscape, it's soccer. However, US soccer fans are few and far between. Apart from the popularity of soccer during the World Cup, most people don't even know the name of the professional soccer organization in their area."

workspace: "The workspace is a concept that refers to the visual environment that contains all hierarchies with all of their nodes, nodes that may be floating around detached from hierarchies, and the information regarding the physical position and status of all nodes within the design space, even those detached from the hierarchies. You may think of the workspace as your desktop. It is not part of any of the hierarchies; instead, it contains them."
