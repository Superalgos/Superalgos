A backtesting session node must reference a trading system to gain access to the trading logic to be applied during the session. Other considerations framing the session come from the set of parameters attached to it.

To add a backtesting session, select *Add Backtesting Session* on the trading process instance node menu. When a session is added, it is created with the full set of parameters.

<!-- CONFIGURING starts -->

Select *Configure Session* on the menu to access the configuration.

```json
{
"folderName": "Session-Name"
}
```

* ```folderName``` allows you to set a significant name to the folder in which the data products&mdash;and logs&mdash;generated by the session are stored. If left blank, the system names the folders with the session id. This may be handy when you intend to consult the raw data generated by the session, as, otherwise, the folder would be hard to identify.

<!-- STARTING starts -->

Before you start a backtesting session, the corresponding task needs to be running, as it is the task that puts the trading bot instance to run. Once the trading bot instance is running, select *Run* on the menu to start the session.

After a few seconds, a literal indication of the progress of the calculations appears below the session node, displaying the date that is currently being processed. Once the calculation is finished, the session stops and the date below the session node dissapears.

To stop a backtesting session, select *Stop* on the menu.
