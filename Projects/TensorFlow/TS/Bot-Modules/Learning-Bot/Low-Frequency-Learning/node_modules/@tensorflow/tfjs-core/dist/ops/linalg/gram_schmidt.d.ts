 * Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization.

 * ```js
 * const x = tf.tensor2d([[1, 2], [3, 4]]);
 * let y = tf.linalg.gramSchmidt(x);
 * y.print();
 * console.log('Othogonalized:');
 * y.dot(y.transpose()).print();  // should be nearly the identity matrix.
 * console.log('First row direction maintained:');
 * const data = await y.array();
 * console.log(data[0][1] / data[0][0]);  // should be nearly 2.
 * ```
 *
 * @param xs The vectors to be orthogonalized, in one of the two following
 *   formats:
 *   - An Array of `tf.Tensor1D`.
 *   - A `tf.Tensor2D`, i.e., a matrix, in which case the vectors are the rows
 *     of `xs`.
 *   In each case, all the vectors must have the same length and the length
 *   must be greater than or equal to the number of vectors.
 * @returns The orthogonalized and normalized vectors or matrix.
 *   Orthogonalization means that the vectors or the rows of the matrix
 *   are orthogonal (zero inner products). Normalization means that each
 *   vector or each row of the matrix has an L2 norm that equals `1`.
