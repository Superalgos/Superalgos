# AACloudPlatform

This repository holds the code of the bits of the AA Platform that run in the cloud.

## About the AA Project

The AA Platform is built and maintained by Advanced Algos, the start up behind the AA Project.

Our mission is to enable the fast-paced evolution of crypto trading bots within the context of trading bots competitions.

The project hosts competitions in which multidisciplinary teams (developers, traders, analysts, etc) create open source bots, a class of which end up competing against each other. Just like with any other open source project, developers are free to fork any bot's source code to add their own innovations. Forked bots then compete with the original ones, sparking a fierce around-the-clock evolutionary competition.

Both the AAPlatform and AA Bots are programed in JavaScript.
