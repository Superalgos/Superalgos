        "text": "For a group of trader friends to come together and decide to endeavour on an automatic trading project, and then achieve the beta 11 version of this project, is pretty cool. \nAnd taking into account the unprecedented nature of this project, bordering on revolutionary, as well as the planned future functionalities and other significant project goals, I can only shake my head in absolute WONDER.\nAlso, I was only starting out on my journey with trading bots, barely gone through my 20 or 50 tabs I had open, and somehow I stumbled across SuperAlgos. I was immediately captured by your project. Nothing else got my attention this strongly.\n\nAlso thanks, because it saved me time going through those 50 other tabs!\nI immediately went and got a Raspberry Pi 4 B, after thinking about getting one for almost 10 years.\n\nAnyway, my words cannot do justice to your amazing project.\nAnd I havent even scratched the surface yet.\n\nLooking forward to mastering your platform and your future functionalities & project milestones.\nIntegration with Ethereum nodes? Holy cow.\n\nPlease just make sure you continue to honor the right to financial privacy, financial sovereignty, anonimity, individual privacy, etc. As much as your platform/project is able to.\nWe cannot and should not allow the SEC and similar \"authorities\" to interfere with projects like these.\nPlease make sure your platform is/will be 100% resistant against questionable centralised power structures...\n\nThanks\nJerome",
