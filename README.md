Superalgos is not just another open-source project. We are an open and welcoming community devised, nurtured, and incentivized with the project's native <a href="https://superalgos.org/token-overview.shtml" target="_blank">Superalgos (SA) token</a> to grow into a massive trading collaboration. You will notice the difference as soon as you join the [Telegram Community Group](https://t.me/superalgoscommunity) or the new [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/CGeKC6WQQb).

# The Superalgos Project

## Superalgos is a token-incentivized open-source project

The protocol incentivizes users to improve Superalgos. To do that, users contribute to the codebase, add to the library of trading intelligence, and help with project development in general, earning Superalgos (SA) tokens for their contributions. Protocol-incentivized contributions allow the project to distribute free of charge, high-quality trading intelligence over the Superalgos peer-to-peer network, currently in the making.

## Superalgos is an open-network project built on top of other open networks: Internet + Bitcoin + Lightning

Because it's an open network, our target audience is, theoretically, 8 billion people. While all products and services provided by the project are free of charge, third-party products and services distributed through the Superalgos Network will be payable in bitcoin over the Lighting Network.

## The Superalgos Network is an open trading intelligence network distributing trading signals

Anyone may plug in to provide or consume trading signals in a permissionless manner. Signals are cryptographically signed by trading intelligence providers with a reputation reflected in their token holdings. The Superalgos p2p Network prioritizes signals distribution according to the token holdings of consumers.

## Superalgos has a scalable and defensible business model

* Everything is open-source and free of charge for all users: trading automation tools to produce trading intelligence, and mobile apps to consume it.

* Algo traders compete to mine SA tokens, producing high-quality, ever-evolving trading intelligence paid for by the protocol.

* Trading Intelligence is distributed via a p2p network with zero network fees.

* The long-term viability is guaranteed since the business model is undisruptable.

## With all friction removed, mass adoption is inevitable

* Users do not pay for the mobile app.

* Users do not pay for trading intelligence.

* Algo traders do not pay for the tools to produce trading intelligence.

* Trading Intelligence does not need to be bought or sold. The project pays for trading intelligence by minting new tokens and distributes intelligence to all users, free of charge.

* The Superalgos (SA) token use case does not require spending, avoiding blockchain fees. Only wallet balance is relevant to determining the reputation and skin in the game of intelligence providers. The same is true for consumers. It is their wallet balance that defines the order of distribution of signals.

## Holding the SA Token is the business model for all participants

* Buying pressure will come from users competing to be among the first to receive trading signals.

* Algo traders build up their holdings by producing top trading intelligence and compete for the reputation entailed in their holdings.

* Project developers earn tokens for their contributions.

## Superalgos will become a powerful consumer brand because it is user-centric:

* We are building a brand 100% in line with consumer interests.

* We cherish the values of a decentralized, token-incentivized, open-source project.

* The project acts as a union, acquiring benefits for users, like better exchange fees for all. 

* We do not collect or sell user data.

* We do not sell ads.

* We do not collect or sell user trading information.

* We know how we are going to make money: token appreciation.

* Founders and team are just token holders, like every other contributor.

## Superalgos Mobile Apps will feature a seamless user experience

* The app will consume top-quality trading intelligence and autonomously execute trades.

* Users will select an exchange, provide an exchange access token, define their base asset, initial capital, and trading intelligence providers. 

* A mobile phone will become a 24/7 trading bot plugged into the Superalgos Network, receiving trading signals and firing orders on any exchange.

* Similar to a bitcoin wallet, anyone will be able to develop Superalgos Mobile Apps to consume trading signals. This open competition will be a race to the best UX possible.

* Crypto wallets and trading apps will plug into the Superalgos Network and consume real-time trading intelligence for free.

## The Superalgos Project does not sell tokens

The protocol distributes Superalgos (SA) Tokens after each software release, among contributors of that release. If you wish to mine tokens, you may start contributing anytime. You may also hire/sponsor someone (usually a developer or trader) to do it on your behalf.

# Software Architecture

Superalgos features three main components:

1. **Superalgos Platform:** A set of tools designed for algo-traders to design, build, test, and deploy trading bots and produce trading signals. The platform has been trading live since mid-2020 and is virtually ready to go out of beta.

2. **Superalgos Mobile:** An under-development mobile app reference implementation that consumes existing trading intelligence to automate trading.

3. **Superalgos Network:** An under-development open p2p network for distributing trading intelligence from providers (algo-traders) to consumers (the project's user base). 

All of the above is or will be hosted in this repository.

# Superalgos is User-centric

* No ads, anywhere.

* No sign-up / logins.

* No user/usage data collection of any kind.

* No user trading information collected or sold.

* Runs 100% on uncompiled code anyone can read and audit.

# Superalgos Development Pipeline

* **Superalgos P2P Network:** Will allow the project to distribute trading intelligence produced by algo-traders.

* **Trading Signals:** Will allow providers to broadcast trading signals and be rewarded with SA Tokens.

* **Superalgos Mobile:** Will allow users to consume trading signals for free and autonomously execute trades from their mobile phones.

* **Ethereum Integration:** Will allow mining data from an Ethereum network node, and bring it into the Superalgos workflow.

# What is the Superalgos Platform?

Superalgos Platform is a set of tools to automate crypto-trading. It is implemented as a Node JS Client + Web App that runs on your hardware and scales from a single Raspberry Pi to a Trading Farm. The Platform is fully functional and has been used for trading live since 2020. 

At Beta 12, trading signals will be able to be sent to the Suerpalgos Network from the Superalgos Platform.

* No need to integrate a charting library, Superalgos features an integrated Charting System.
* No need to manage task data or execution dependencies. Superalgos allows you to define Tasks and distribute them across a Trading Farm and takes care of the data and execution dependencies so that each task automatically starts when their dependencies are ready.

## Superalgos Platform is Permissionless

* Don't like the UI?
* Don't like the icons used?
* Don't like the Charting System?

No problem, code or integrate libraries with your own version of any component and we promise we will merge your work and provide it as an alternative to users. We believe in Permissionless Innovation and that users, not team members, are the final judges and the ones who decide what they prefer to use. You are free to create an alternative for any part of the system that you believe that should work or should have been done in a different way. We will help you integrate your vision into the next release and enable a way for users to choose between different implementations of the same functionality. You will also be granted the title of maintainer of the functionality you provide and have decision power on how it evolves in the future.

# Support

We just opened a brand new [Discord server for Support and the Community](https://discord.gg/CGeKC6WQQb).

We also meet on several Telegram groups, where it all started!

> **BEWARE OF IMPERSONATORS — SCAMMERS ARE LURKING!**
Superalgos Admins, the Core Team, and Community Mods will never contact you directly unless you contact them first. We will never ask you for API keys, coins, or cash. In fact, we will never ask you to trust us in any way. Our [Community Safety Policy](https://superalgos.org/community-safety-policy.shtml) explains why. In short, we want to make it clear that if someone contacts you directly claiming to work with or for the project, it is a scam.
