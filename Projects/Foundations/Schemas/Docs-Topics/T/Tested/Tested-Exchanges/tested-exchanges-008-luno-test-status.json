            "text": "Comments: Raw Data mining is extremely slow due to exchange restrictions on their API that limit the number of data it can be requested via Rest API. One day of Raw Data used to take about 5 minutes to download. However, since a recent upgrade (somewhere around 15th May, 2021) it is no longer possible to retrieve raw trades older than 24 hours. This means that a start day must be fully specified (i.e. both date and time), and it must be less than 24 hours behind the current date/time. Keep this in mind when setting a start date. The reason for this is because they do not support fetching of OHCLV data - this data has to be compiled by fetching individual trades. The fetching of trades is limited to 100 trades per request, and the rate limit is 1 second. Furthermore, you will need to run data mining for at least 24 hours before being able to start running any trading.",
