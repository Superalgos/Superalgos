 * Computes the log(sum(exp(elements across the reduction dimensions)).
 *
 * Reduces the input along the dimensions given in `axis`. Unless `keepDims`
 * is true, the rank of the array is reduced by 1 for each entry in `axis`.
 * If `keepDims` is true, the reduced dimensions are retained with length 1.
 * If `axis` has no entries, all dimensions are reduced, and an array with a
 * single element is returned.
 *
 * ```js
 * const x = tf.tensor1d([1, 2, 3]);

 *
 * const axis = 1;
 * x.logSumExp(axis).print();  // or tf.logSumExp(a, axis)
 * ```
 * @param x The input tensor.
 * @param axis The dimension(s) to reduce. If null (the default),
 *     reduces all dimensions.
 * @param keepDims If true, retains reduced dimensions with length
