/**
 * Extracts a slice from a `tf.Tensor` starting at coordinates `begin`
 * and is of size `size`.
 *
 * Also available are stricter rank-specific methods with the same signature
 * as this method that assert that `x` is of the given rank:
 *   - `tf.slice1d`
 *   - `tf.slice2d`
 *   - `tf.slice3d`
 *   - `tf.slice4d`
 *
 * ```js
 * const x = tf.tensor1d([1, 2, 3, 4]);
 *
 * x.slice([1], [2]).print();
 * ```
 *
 * ```js
 * const x = tf.tensor2d([1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 2]);
 *
 * x.slice([1, 0], [1, 2]).print();
 * ```
 * @param x The input `tf.Tensor` to slice from.
 * @param begin The coordinates to start the slice from. The length can be
 *     less than the rank of x - the rest of the axes will have implicit 0 as
 *     start. Can also be a single number, in which case it specifies the
 *     first axis.
 * @param size The size of the slice. The length can be less than the rank of
 *     x - the rest of the axes will have implicit -1. A value of -1 requests
 *     the rest of the dimensions in the axis. Can also be a single number,
 *     in which case it specifies the size of the first axis.
