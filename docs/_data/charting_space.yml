charting_space: "The Charting Space is the hierarchy that governs the configuration of the charts."

viewport: "The viewport represents the bidimensional space on which charts are drawn."

dashboard: "A dashboard is a collection of time machines, each containing any number of charts."

time_machine: "A time machine synchronizes multiple timeline charts over the same timeline. Timeline charts within a time machine may have different rate scales or time frame scales, but their time scale will always match."

time_scale: "The time scale controls the scale of the horizontal axis, that is, the timeline of the corresponding time machine, and of all of the timeline charts within it."

rate_scale: "The rate scale controls the scale of the vertical axis, that is, the scale of the quoted asset, either of the time machine or of the timeline chart, depending on where the node is located."

time_frame_scale: "The time frame scale controls the time frame setting, that is, the period represented by each candle, either of the time machine or of the timeline chart, depending on where the node is located."

timeline_chart: "The timeline chart represents a chart within a time machine, which may have independent rate and time frame scales, as well as particular layers."

layers_manager: "The layer manager determines which layers will be visible on the corresponding timeline chart."

layer: "A layer represents a reference to a data product in the data storage node of the network hierarchy. Conceptually, it means that a certain data product, which exists in a certain location on the network, holds the data to be rendered on the charts."
