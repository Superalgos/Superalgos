# Contributing

We are thrilled you are interested in contributing to this repository. Your help may be essential to the project's success and we want you in! 

Superalgos is a collective project, currently at a very early stage. Although this repository is not open source software yet, we do welcome contributions from the community.

Contributions are deemed _voluntary work_. There might be incentives in place for certain kinds of contributions. Contact us for more information in this regard.

In any case, contributors agree to provide an express grant of patent rights for their contributions. Submitting Pull Requests to this repository represents an express agreement with the terms of our Balanced Contributor Intellectual Property Agreement. This agreement is a direct implementation of GitHub's [Balanced Employee Intellectual Property Agreement 1.0.1](https://github.com/github/balanced-employee-ip-agreement/blob/master/Balanced_Employee_IP_Agreement.md).

# Balanced Contributor Intellectual Property Agreement 1.0.1

This BALANCED CONTRIBUTOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AGREEMENT is between person or team submitting Pull Requests to this repository and Superalgos.org ("Project").

**What is this?** This is the Project's Intellectual Property Agreement ("Agreement"). If you've worked in the technology space before, there's a good chance that you've run across one or more of these in the past. This document is the official, entire and exclusive agreement on what intellectual property ("IP") is yours, and what belongs to the Project.

**Why is this?** The Project needs to be clear on what IP it owns and has rights to. Its customers, contributors, and investors depend on the Project having the legal rights to the products and services it is providing so that the Project can continue operating and doing business.

The Project also believes that it's important to be clear on what it doesn't own. The Project doesn't want you looking over your shoulder every time you work on something personal or worrying that the Project will someday seize your open source non-lethal mousetrap simulation software. In other words, the Project isn't interested in appropriating your personal projects.

**Read this.** Please read this document and be sure you understand it before you submit any Pull Requests. Due to legal risk and corporate obligations, the Project cannot, by and large, negotiate its terms. If you feel you have a particular circumstance that keeps you from signing, please let the Project's legal department ("Legal") know. And, of course, you're always free and encouraged to get your own legal counsel to explain anything you're not clear on.

Cool? Then, by submitting your first Pull Request, and as a condition of your contribution, you agree to the following:

1. **What the Project owns.** The Project owns any IP ("Project IP") that you create, or help create _as its contributor_, but only if it meets one or more of these additional conditions: The IP was (i) related to an existing or prospective Project product or service at the time you developed, invented, or created it, (ii) developed for use by the Project, or (iii) developed or promoted with existing Project IP or with the Project's endorsement. You hereby grant and assign, and will grant and assign, to the Project all rights and interests in all Project IP.

   "Project IP" includes concepts, designs, developments, discoveries, ideas, improvements, inventions, trade secrets, trademarks, and works of authorship.

2. **What the Project doesn't own.** If you create IP that doesn't fit into one of the categories listed above, the Project doesn't own it. In other words, the Project doesn't own concepts, designs, developments, discoveries, ideas, improvements, inventions, trade secrets, trademarks, or works of authorship that you develop, invent, or create that do not meet any of the conditions in Section 1. 

3. **Contribution of your IP to Project projects.** If you include your own IP – such as IP you created prior to working for the Project – into a Project product or service, it's still yours, of course, but you grant the Project a non-exclusive, irrevocable, fully paid-up, royalty-free, perpetual, sublicensable, transferable, worldwide license to use it without restriction in any way or implementation, in modified form, or as is, by itself, or incorporated into another product or service ("License"). If you include your name in any project over which the Project would have rights under this Agreement, such as in a copyright notice or a comment in code or documentation, then the License covers the rights associated with that use of your name as well.

4. **Your contributions to non-Project projects.** The Project recognizes that you may be engaged in work that requires you to submit IP to entities other than the Project, such as open source projects used by the Project. Please make sure that Legal is aware of what you're working on so that Legal can help with any licensing issues. If any project asks you to sign a contribution agreement, you should check with Legal before doing so. These agreements may be legally binding on the Project and so should be run through Legal first.

5. **Voluntary Works** All Project IP that you are involved with or create as part of your work for the Project is voluntary work which does not require compensation. There might be incentives in place for certain kinds of contributions. Feel free to contact the Project to learn more.

6. **No conflicts.** You agree that you don't have any outstanding agreements or obligations that conflict with those in this Agreement, and that you won't enter into conflicting agreements in the future.

7. **IP protection.** The Project might someday need to show the work that went into the development of IP that it uses or has used, or to make government filings to establish that it owns the IP or has rights over it. To help in those situations, you agree not to destroy any records you maintain relating to the development of any Project IP or IP under License (together, "All IP"), and, if the Project asks, to provide those records to the Project. You agree to help the Project secure and defend its rights in All IP. For your help the Project will compensate you at a reasonable rate. If the Project is unable to secure your help, you authorize the Project to act on your behalf (as your agent and attorney-in-fact) in securing all rights related to All IP.

8. **Confidentiality.** As an contributor or contractor of the Project, you will have access to sensitive confidential information that is important to the Project's business. You are responsible for keeping this information confidential, including after you end your work for the Project.

   "Confidential Information" includes non-public technical details about our products or services, financial information, business strategies and forecasts, customer data, or any other information, data or know-how that is valuable to the Project because it is not publicly known.

   The Project's Confidential Information is sensitive and we expect that you'll treat it as such. You agree to only use the Project's Confidential Information for the purpose of performing your contribution and for the benefit of the Project. You will do your best to keep Confidential Information secret. If you are not sure if something is Confidential Information, you should assume that it is, until you can confirm otherwise.
